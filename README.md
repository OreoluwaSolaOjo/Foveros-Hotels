# Foveros-Hotels
Hotel Booking System with User Authentication, Redux for Global State Management and Payment Integration.
I am using React for frontend and Django for the backend.
Other technologies being used are Redux for state management, Material UI for styling, React-Router-Dom for routing, Django DJoser library for JWT authentication,
Postgresql Database.
Still a work in progress.
